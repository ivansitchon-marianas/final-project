    <h3>About US</h3>
        <p>This is a website that is dedicated to people that are just active or just outdoors in any part of the world. Being able to post their events and really get into detail all about their outdoor adventures, sharing their whole experience overall. Yes there are other social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, etc.. but that part of the social world is just a few snippets here and there whereas this website will get into depth about everyone’s experiences.
        </p>
        <p>The reason for this website is to test how a wonderful and interactive website and experience it would be overall, the person or people experiencing it and being able to share it with the world in a more clean format. I also thought about the people that would be viewing other people’s posts as well and thought it would help inspire them to post as well or to even go outside to experience new things if they haven’t already. Sharing what it took for them to go outside and live then sharing what inspired them to do so.
